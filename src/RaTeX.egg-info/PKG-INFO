# Install
If you don't have LaTeX installed, go to https://www.overleaf.com/ and copy + paste the "/build/main.tex" file code into the editor!
```py
pip install ratex
```

# Preview

<h3>Code</h3>

```py
from ratex import Build, Text, Packages

# // New Ratex build
r: Build = Build("main.tex", __file__)
r.new(
    doc_class = "article", 
    title = "RaTeX Physics Lab", 
    author = "Tristan Simpson",
    packages = [
        "{multirow}",
        "{cancel}", # custom packages or
        Packages.changepage, # use the ones provided
    ]
)

# // Observations
r.add_header("Observations", enumerate = False)
r.add_text(b=False, it=False, content=r"""
    Using the two provided objects we could calculate net force of the 
    bounceback from a mass and a string. By 30kg the string broke after the mass was dropped. 
    The table below describes our group observations.\newline\newline
""")
r.add_table(columns = 3, headers = ["Mass ($kg$)", "Height ($m$)", "Force (N)"], data = [
    "10kg", "11.4m", "108.73N",
    "20kg", "16.7m", "276.52N",
])

# // Procedure
r.add_header("Procedure", enumerate = False)
r.add_list(type = "enumerate", items = [
    r.text(r"The string was attached to the table."),
    r.text(r"The mass was attached to the opposite end of the string."),
    r.text(r"The mass was dropped and the bounceback height was measured."),
    r.text(r"The net force was calculated.")
])

# // Finalize the build
r.done()
```
